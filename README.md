# GIS Package for Antarcitca's Sedimentary Basins

**AntBasins** is an open repository for hosting the Antarctica's Sedimentary Basins GIS package. It includes the sedimentary basin distribution, sedimentary basin type, and sedimentary basin age. The goal of this project is to build a community-derived knowledge of Antarctica's Sedimentary Basins.
